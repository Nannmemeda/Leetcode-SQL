SELECT user_id, name, mail
FROM users
WHERE mail LIKE '[a-zA-Z]%@leetcode.com' -- [a-zA-Z] means the string needs to start with lower or upper letter, @leetcode.com means the string needs to end with that pattern
AND left(mail, len(mail)-13) NOT like '%[^A-Za-z0-9_.-]%' --this guarantees anything before @ is not like anything other than lower or upper letter, or digits or _.- for example it takes out # in the use case.
